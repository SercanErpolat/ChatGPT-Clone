# ChatGPT-Clone

Hello everyone, this project aims to create a chatGPT clone that I am trying to create based on the gpt-3 model developed by the OpenAI company, which has been talked about frequently lately.

ChatGPT is a language model that can understand conversations with its natural language processing capabilities.

In this project where I used API, I tried to code based on ChatGPT.

Used technologies:

- HTML
  
- CSS

- JAVASCRIPT

<h2> ChatGPT Clone Screen </h1>
